 * Some basic info:                                                                           *

 * These are the default style values for PygameUILib (GitHub.com/Hugo4IT/PygameUILib)        *
 * Styling in PygameUILib works in exacly the same way as plain css, meaning that stylesheets *
 * are interchangable between PygameUILib and HTML, that way you can demo and create your     *
 * css files from your favorite editor with all code-completions and themes you could ever    *
 * want. Ofcourse not all values will translate to PygameUILib instantly since there are      *
 * a crap ton of css attributes that aren't yet implemented in PygameUILib yet. Stylesheets   *
 * CAN be easily transfered from PygameUILib to HTML without issues since the syntax is the   *
 * same. This software is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0                  *
