# PygameUILib by Hugo4IT
### WORK IN PROGRESS, PLEASE DONT USE YET
#### Please go to bottom of the page for progress info
A simple, fast GUI solution for Pygame. [WORK-IN-PROGRESS] Please do not use yet, big changes are planned, so your code will probably not work in future versions. PygameUILib only has 1 dependency: pygame. Meaning that this library doesn't require any other library to function. This library also includes a CSS interpreter for styling, this interpreter has a big O notation of O(n) meaning that it is very fast and doesn't scale exponentially based on filesize!

#### Speed
I have done some speed tests with this css interpreter and these are the results
- #### Test 1 **Description**: Some random css file from microsoft.com
  **Filesize**: `4209 lines 107kb`
  **Results**:
    #### Ryzen 5 3600X
    ```Done in 0.7 seconds```
    #### Pentium N4200
    ```Done in 1.2 seconds```

## Installation:
- #### Windows
  - Open command prompt
  - Enter `pip install PygameUILib`
  - Done
